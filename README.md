# Terminal Portfolio

Hello! âœ¨ This was a fork from the amazing [Hugo theme named Terminal by panr](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal).  
It added the possibility of showing a grid portfolio. However, I have since expanded it alot for my personal webpage.  
The new repository is here: https://github.com/Louisload/hugo-theme-terminal-extended/  

If you want to have this feature but updated to the most recent version of Terminal, check out version 1.0.0 of it.

Please give it a visit and check if the other new features are of any interest to you :) I wont update this one anymore.

## How to Use
A portfolio works as any normal section would. Consider the example below, of a section called "portfolio" with three items:

```
- exampleSite
-- content
--- portfolio
---- _index.md
---- portfolio_item1.md
---- portfolio_item2.md
---- portfolio_item3.md
```

In the `\_index.md` file to your section, add the following to the header:
``isPortfolio = true`` 

Then, for each portfolio item, add an image to your static files. I recommend them being square as per the example screenshots, although other resolutions might work too (they might look funky tho ðŸ˜¶). Link the images to your portfolio items by adding the following to their header:
``portfolioCover = "path_to_image.png"``

If you want to add icons, add them to the header too:
``portfolioIcons=["icon1.svg", "icon2.svg", "icon3.svg"]``

I recommend getting icons from [SimpleIcons](https://simpleicons.org/)

Using the steps above, you can have as many portfolios in your site as you want. As an example, you could have a "Photography" section with photos and a "Drawings" with drawings.

## Sub sections
You can also organise your portfolio with subsections. Just add them as subfolders of the original section. For instance:
```
- exampleSite
-- content
--- portfolio
---- Mona Lisas
----- _index.md
----- portfolio_item1.md
----- portfolio_item2.md
----- portfolio_item3.md
---- Earrings
----- _index.md
----- portfolio_item1.md
----- portfolio_item2.md
----- portfolio_item3.md
```

**Visit the folder `exampleSite` for examples**
